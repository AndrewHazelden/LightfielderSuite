## Photoshop Install ##

**Step 1.**

Install the .jsx scripts files from the `Presets/Scripts` folder to:

`C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CC <Version Number>\Presets\Scripts\`

`/Applications/Adobe Photoshop <Version Number>/Presets/Scripts`

Install the .atn actions files from the `Presets/Actions` folder to:

`C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CC <Version Number>\Presets\Actions\`

`/Applications/Adobe Photoshop <Version Number>/Presets/Actions`

Install the `Lightfielder.asl` style file from the `Presets/Styles` folder to:

`C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CC <Version Number>\Presets\Styles\`

`/Applications/Adobe Photoshop <Version Number>/Presets/Styles`

**Step 2.** Load the .atn actions in Photoshop by showing the Actions tab using the "Window > Action" menu.

In the Actions tab use the "humburger menu" stacked icon to access the extra options. Select the "Lightfielder Guides", "Lightfielder Quilt", and the "Lightfielder Workflow" actions.

**Step 3.** Load the .asl styles in Photoshop by showing the Styles tab using the "Window > Styles" menu.

In the Styles tab use the "humburger menu" stacked icon to access the extra options. Select the "Lightfielder" item. If you click "OK" all the existing styles will be cleared out from the Styles tab. Alternatively, you can append these styles to the existing entries you have.

**Step 4.** Restart Photoshop if it is currently running. You are now ready to use the Lightfielder tools in Photoshop.

**Step 5.** You may want to customize the Lightfielder jsx scripts using a programmer's text editor like Notepad++ (Windows), or BBEdit (macOS).

## Lightfielder Scripts ##

The following JSX scripts are provided by Lightfielder for Photoshop:

- Lightfielder - Send to DJV View.jsx
- Lightfielder - Send to Looking Glass Display (Legacy).jsx
- Lightfielder - Send to Quiltr (Legacy).jsx
- Lightfielder - Set Metadata.jsx

**Note:** *The two JSX scripts marked with `(Legacy)` are included as examples that you can pick apart for learning purposes. But TBH they will likely be of little use to most new Looking Glass users who are just getting started in 2019 and beyond since the CLI (command-line) tools they relied on have been discontinued.*
